# Terraform-CHKP-AWS-April22-2024-Demo - Terraform configuration to demonstrate Check Point security Infrastructure as code

You can find the latest Terraform executable at: https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html

You can finf the latest Check Point Terraform provider documentation at: https://registry.terraform.io/providers/CheckPointSW/checkpoint/latest/docs

Example Policy creation with the Check Point Terraform Provider

Source your credentials for the SmartCenter or MDS using the creds file. The Check Point Terraform provider will read them from the enviroment. For Example

On unix/linux run: ```source creds_``` or ```source creds_MDS```

### Publish best options and practices
As of right now, Terraform does not provide native support for post publish and install-policy. There are a cople of diffrent ways to handle that:
- Out of band publish using
  - Python (publish.py)
  - shell (publish.bat)
  - publish executable from the Check Point provider source code to publish the changes see https://registry.terraform.io/providers/CheckPointSW/checkpoint/latest/docs#post-apply--destroy-scripts for details.

- Trigger field (best practice)
  
  From version 1.2 the provider was enhanced where a triggers field for resource install_policy, publish and logout was added for re-execution if there are any changes in this list
  ```hcl
  # Put the Check Point configuration in a sub folder and refer to is as a module
  module "chkp_policy" {
    source = "./chkp_policy"
  }
  
  # Activate the trigger if there is a change in the configuration files in the folder chkp_policy
  locals {
    publish_triggers = [for filename in fileset(path.module, "chkp_policy/*.tf"): filesha256(filename)]
  }
  
  # Make the publish resources dependent of the module and **trigger** it if there is a change in the   configuration files
  resource "checkpoint_management_publish" "publish" { 
    depends_on = [ module.policy ]
    triggers = local.publish_triggers
  }
  ```

- Avoid large bulk publishes

  From version 2.5.0 the provider was enhanced with support to auto publish mode using **auto_publish_batch_size** or via the **CHECKPOINT_AUTO_PUBLISH_BATCH_SIZE** environment variable to configure the number of batch size to automatically run publish.

  ```hcl
  # Check Point Provider source and version used terraform {
  required_providers {
    checkpoint = {
      source = "checkpointsw/checkpoint"
      version  = "~> 2.6.0" 
      }
    }
  }
  # Configure the Check Point Provider
  provider "checkpoint" {
    server   = "chkp-mgmt-srv.local"
    api_key = "Check Point admin api key"
    context  = "web_api“
    auto_publish_batch_size = “100”
  }
  ```

- Control publish post destroy
  
  From version 2.6.0 the provider was enhanced where a new flag was added **run_publish_on_destroy** to **checkpoint_management_publish** which indicates whether to run publish on destroy
  
  ```hcl
  # Make the publish resources dependent of the module and trigger it if there is a change in the   configuration files
  resource "checkpoint_management_publish" "publish" { 
    depends_on = [ module.policy ]
    triggers = local.publish_triggers
    run_publish_on_destroy = true
    }
  ```


You execute terraform with:
```
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

remove everything with: 
```
terraform destroy
```
The terraform demo will create hosts, networks, services, custom applications, domain objects, cynamic objects, policy packages, layers and populate that policy package with rules.
